# frakshr
a game based loosely upon various code concepts i worked on a long time ago made in legacy GML

Note: To open any of the code, use https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18368808/Game.Maker.8.Pro.Edition.zip
It's very old, Windows only, and doesn't have full functionality on anything newer than Windows 7.

Any released compiled versions of the game will also likely be Windows only, unless you use software like Wine (https://www.winehq.org/) to run Windows exclusive apps on Mac/Linux.

The IDE and compiled versions may ask you to install DirectPlay. You don't need it to run it (as far as I can tell) but it will bother you to install it until you do.

If the code gives a Windows system dialogue that says the app shouldn't run, click more info, then run. 
On my offbrand Temu earbuds, there is no malware in this, it's just sketchy. If you don't want to run it, don't. 

If you want to make fun of my code, feel free to do so as long as there's some silver lining of productivity in it. 

Your keyboard may also be a limiting factor in your ability to run any of this, as you need to be able to press a lot of keys to run this, and your keyboard
has to register them. If it doesn't, that's unfortunate. The file "frakshr v3.gmk" has a good test inside it to see how many of your keys register on your keyboard.
